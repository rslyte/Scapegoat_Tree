CS450: ScapeGoat Data Structure

What I'm Submitting in this archive:
tree.txt: test file
scape_goat.py: python executable file containing the data structure and code
this README

*******Tested on: Ubuntu 14.04, python 2.7.6
*******To run:In terminal, type 'chmod +x scape_goat.py' (if it's needed), then './scape_goat.py' with the tree.txt in the same directory
*******Notes: My program assumes no blank lines in the file. I insert all values from test file on Angel course site, and also delete some nodes and search for some nodes, reporting if they are found in the structure or not. Structure is printed by tree level. 'Print' command is called to show the final resulting tree before 'Done' command is given to exit.

QUESTIONS/CONCERNS: email me. I've submitted two python programs without testing them on the lab machines for networking and got 100%, 97.5% so I'm assuming my version of python on my machine is compatible with WSUV's version of CentOS.
